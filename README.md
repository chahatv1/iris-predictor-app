#  Streamlit Iris Classifier

This project is a web-based machine learning application built using Streamlit. It predicts the species of an iris flower based on user-inputted features like sepal and petal length and width. The app utilizes a Random Forest model trained on the classic Iris dataset and provides real-time predictions along with a visualization of feature importance to help interpret model behavior.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning models can be deployed as interactive and accessible web applications. It also serves as a hands-on example of integrating model training, UI design, and visualization within a single Python-based solution.

Ideal for beginner to intermediate data science portfolios, this project showcases:
- End-to-end ML workflow (training, saving, deploying)
- UI interaction with Streamlit
- Real-time prediction and visual model explainability
- Clean code organization
